-> HTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines 
    how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.
	
    HTTP is called a stateless protocol because each command is executed independently, without any knowledge 
    of the commands that came before it. This is the main reason that it is difficult to implement Web sites that react 
	intelligently to user input. 
	
	The first command is HTTP head request. HTTP headers are the code that transfers data between a Web server and 
	a browser. HTTP headers are mainly intended for the communication between the server and client in both directions. 
	 
	The respone for the above command i received is as follows
